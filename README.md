## Description  
This application allows you to see quickly the employee directory and filter by name. It uses [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) to get some random users data such as profile pictures and names. The application uses [React](https://reactjs.org/), [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) and [Boothstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/).  


## User Story and Details  

```
User Story Acceptance Criteria
```
```
As a user,  
I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.  
WHEN an employee or manager view the directory,  
they should only view non-sensitive data about other employees. 
WHEN a user see the directory,  
he can sort employees names by alphabetic order.  
WHEN a user search the directory,  
he can filter employees by name so it is easier to find a specific employee record.  

```
